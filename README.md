#DESCRPTION
âœ… Current Project Features:
ealistic LCD display simulation showing temperature, status, and counter Interactive push button functionality with debouncing simulation Temperature sensor readings with realistic fluctuations Serial monitor output displaying real-time data Circuit design visualization with component connections Complete Arduino code with proper sensor integration Temperature analytics with trend analysis Unit conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit Design Elements:

Professional dashboard layout with intuitive controls Authentic LCD display styling with green-on-black text Interactive circuit diagram showing component connections Real-time temperature chart with statistics Serial monitor window mimicking Arduino IDE CODTECH branding and internship project identification Responsive design optimized for demonstration purposes Clean, modern interface with production-ready styling The system simulates a complete Arduino-based temperature monitoring project with DS18B20 sensor, 16x2 LCD display, and push button counter. You can start/stop the simulation, reset the system, press the virtual button to increment the counter, and toggle between temperature units. The project demonstrates all required deliverables including circuit design, code implementation, and working output demonstration.
